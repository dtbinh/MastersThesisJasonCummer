\textbf{ABSTRACT}
\end{center}

The use of neural nets has been around since the nineteen sixties, it fell out of favor and has returned to a state of interest recently. Computational systems based on the bilogy of the neurvous system have been increased in complexity over the years as the the compuational power of the time increases. 

Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) stated in XXXX with SOMEONE This is the future. 

 There is no claim that this is the \textit{best} or \textit{only} way to structure such a neural network. Yet in the majority of cases it serves extremely well as a sound basis which can be customized according to the requirements of the researchers and the topic of  research. Additionally some examples on using the system are included as a bonus for beginners.
